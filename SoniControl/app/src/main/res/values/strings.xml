    <string name="aboutUsProject">SoniControl is a novel technology for the recognition and masking of acoustic tracking information. The technology helps end-users to protect their privacy. Technologies like Google Nearby and Silverpush build upon ultrasonic sounds to exchange information. More and more of our devices communicate via this inaudible communication channel. Every device with a microphone and a speaker is able to send and receive ultrasonic information. The user is usually not aware of this inaudible and hidden data transfer. To overcome this gap SoniControl detects ultrasonic activity, notifies the user and blocks the information on demand. Thereby, we want to raise the awareness for this novel technology.</string>

- We use the microphone to capture sound, but process only the ultrasonic part, we remove everything under 17kHz.\n\n
- Sounds are analyzed in real time on the phone. They are not sent to the web, nor stored on the phone.\n\n
- Detections are stored locally in a JSON file, including the time and location (if allowed by the user). The user can delete this file at any time via the Settings menu.\n\n
- If allowed, we check the user\'s location regularly in order to tell him when he enters an area where he previously detected ultrasonic communications.
